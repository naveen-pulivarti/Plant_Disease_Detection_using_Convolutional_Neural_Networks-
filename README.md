## Project Title
# Plant Disease Detection from Images using CNN

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive Streamlit application that allows users to upload images of plant leaves and accurately predict the presence and type of plant disease using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This project involves designing, implementing, and optimizing a solution that integrates machine learning, computer vision, and user interface development.

## Project Scope
- **End-to-End Development:** Responsible for all aspects of the project, from setting up the image upload interface in Streamlit to training the CNN model and delivering a functional, user-friendly application.
- **Real-World Relevance:** Address practical applications in agriculture, providing a tool that helps farmers or gardeners quickly diagnose plant diseases and take appropriate actions.

## Key Components
1. **User Interface Development:**
   - Designed a Streamlit Application: Created a web interface that allows users to upload images of plant leaves.
   - Ensured application usability with clear instructions and feedback for users.

2. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Implemented image preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and used the New Plant Diseases Dataset from Kaggle.

3. **Disease Classification:**
   - Developed and trained a CNN model to classify plant diseases based on the uploaded images.
   - Evaluated the model's performance against at least three pretrained models and implemented transfer learning for improved accuracy.

4. **Performance and Optimization:**
   - Assessed the CNN model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Ensured efficient application performance with minimal latency for real-time predictions.

5. **Testing:**
   - Conducted extensive testing to ensure the application correctly predicts plant diseases and handles various image inputs effectively.

## Expected Results
- **Functional Application:** A Streamlit-based web application where users can upload images of plant leaves and receive predictions about plant diseases.
- **Model Performance Report:** A detailed analysis of the CNN model’s performance, including accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- **User Guide:** Documentation covering how to use the application, interpret predictions, and provide feedback on potential issues.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** Streamlit, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- **Dataset:** New Plant Diseases Dataset from Kaggle

## Deliverables
